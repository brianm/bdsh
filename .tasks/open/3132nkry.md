Add clap derive-based CLI with basic structure:

```rust
#[derive(Parser)]
struct Cli {
    host_spec: String,           // positional: host source
    #[arg(long)] where_: Option<String>,
    #[arg(long, default_value = "1")] host_col: usize,
    #[arg(long)] host_ptr: Option<String>,
    #[arg(short, long)] output_dir: Option<PathBuf>,
    #[arg(short, long)] keep: bool,
    #[arg(last = true)] command: Vec<String>,
}
```

Just the CLI parsing, no host spec implementation yet. Replace current argv handling with clap.
